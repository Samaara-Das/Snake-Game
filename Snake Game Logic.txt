Let's break down the logic of the Snake game and describe how it will look.
Game Logic:

Game Board: The game takes place on a grid, typically square-shaped.
Each cell in the grid can be empty, contain a part of the snake, or contain food.


Snake: The snake is represented as a list of coordinates on the grid.
It starts with a length of 1-3 cells.
The snake moves in the direction of its head.


Movement: The snake moves one cell at a time in the current direction.
The head moves to a new cell, and the rest of the body follows.
If not eating food, the tail cell is removed to maintain length.


Direction Control: The player can change the snake's direction (up, down, left, right).
The snake cannot reverse direction instantly (e.g., can't go right if moving left).


Food: Food appears randomly on empty cells of the grid.
When the snake's head moves onto a food cell, it "eats" the food.


Growing: When the snake eats food, it grows by one cell.
Growth is achieved by not removing the tail cell on the next move.


Collision Detection: The game checks for collisions with walls (grid boundaries).
It also checks for collisions with the snake's own body.
A collision ends the game.


Scoring: The player's score increases each time the snake eats food.
The score is typically equal to the length of the snake minus its initial length. 
A high score is kept as well.


Game Loop: The game updates at fixed time intervals (e.g., every 200ms).
Each update moves the snake one cell in the current direction.



Visual Appearance:

Game Board: A rectangular grid, usually with a dark background.
Grid lines may be visible or invisible.


Snake: Represented by a series of connected squares or circles.
Often green in color, but can be customized.
The head might be a different color or shape to distinguish it.


Food: A single cell on the grid, distinct from the snake.
Often red and circular, resembling an apple.


Walls: The boundaries of the grid, usually a different color.


Score Display: Typically shown at the top or bottom of the screen.
Displays the current score (snake length or points).


Game Over Screen: Appears when the snake collides with a wall or itself.
Displays final score and option to restart.


Controls: On screen arrows will be used as controls.
